# CourseActivity
Scrapes the website for student work stats

First run StudentURL.py, then CourseActivityURL modded.py, then CourseActivityTrawler master list.py

The first will create a list of all the students' individual URLs.

The second will make a dictionary with the student name as a key and a list of the URLs of the students' courses as the values

The third will check all of the courses against the current date and output a record of how much work they have done in total.
